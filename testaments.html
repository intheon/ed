			<p>I got in touch to Ed through a mutual friend in Night Lives here in Finland and after hearing their stuff, was convinced that we've found our guy! Ed really delivered an awesome set of masters for our upcoming self-titled album. Really wish to catch up over a beer in the future, true gent!<br /></p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Ed was very prompt and efficient when it came to getting my first draft masters back to me. He was always available to talk about the project and took on board my opinions. I was extremely happy with his work I felt it brought a new life to my tracks. I will most certainly be going back to Ed to work on future projects together.<br /></p>
