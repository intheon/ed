			<h1>Recording</h1>

			<p>I have a variety of well equipped and purpose built studios at our disposal and believe I can account for all realistic budgets to get the results the music deserves.</p>

			<p>My approach to recording is very simple - quality starts at the source; time, patience and respect for the song is the true giver of the right tones, the best performances, and the most honest feelings. I feel that when we approach music with such respect for the fundamentals that the right sounding record emerges. It has taken all the years I’ve spent behind both sides of the glass to realise what is truly important when tracking any release and I do my utmost to guide sessions with that level of awareness and with these realisations in mind.</p>

			<h1>Mixing</h1>

			<p>Mixing facilities can be the burden of many records; be it that the budget runs out on renting a facility or that facility just can’t produce the results. As with all stages, mixing demands the proper approach, respect and physical space.</p>

			<p>I have options to suit all budgets but install pride in the mixing and mastering suite I built in my own home for the ease of each record made. It’s important to be comfortable, settled and as un-tainted by deadlines or financial strains as possible (as possible being the operative word here) and when it comes to mixing having such an intimate, personal and familiar space aids the completion of the music and allows us to work in the now all-too-thematic-approach of getting things right for the song.</p>

			<p>As we must always know, the song is above us as humans. It is an entity unto itself and we bring it into existence through our minds, instruments and technologies. In mixing we assess all the elements and place them where they belong to produce the whole.</p>

			<h1>Mastering</h1>

			<p>Mastering brings a lot of joy into my life. It has been described as a ‘dark art’ of audio and is the most commonly misunderstood process. Mastering is the final stage before tracks are submitted away from the studio into the hands of the next processes, it is the last alteration to the sound of a record before the music and audio is considered ‘complete’ and basically ensures the music is ‘competitively loud’ and tonally balanced. As from 2013, after mastering a handsome selection of releases, as the mastering engineer only, I decided to never under almost any circumstance master my own recordings and mixes.</p>

			<p>This approach stemmed from the pure enjoyment I got from hearing an un-mastered mix for the first time having no relationships with the audio whatsoever. The perspective an engineer can have on a record when being hired to objectively decide the best outcome for a mix, already prepared, is just so great. To hone in on the strengths and reduce the weaknesses and to bring out the best in someone else’s already beautiful work... There is no job satisfaction quite like this for me.</p>

			<p>Mastering accounts for a large percentage of my work but I never forget the love or skill of creating the piece that gets sent tobe mastered and never picture a landscape for my career in which recording mixing and mastering aren’t all an extension of my professional abilities or passions.</p>

			<p>Everything in moderation, right?</p>

	<li class="dragend-page history">
		<div class="text">
			<h1>History</h1>


			<p>Music has been deeply entangled in my existence from as far back as I can remember, my old man always had the most bizarre records on – Frank Zappa, Tom Waits, Beef heart, Hendrix... ‘Old Grey Whistle’ test videos lay scattered around the living room. It’s hard not to be influenced or to fall in love with something so embedded in your immediate reality.</p>


			<p>At 12 years old I finally got to play the guitar, a friend I skateboarded with had one and taught me some riffs which was an addictive rush within itself, to just play a guitar and hear something I was controlling. My uncle soon after lent me his red and white squire strat, which stayed in my room many more years than planned. Guitars came and went as did styles of music but these have remained perhaps the only constant in my life - music and guitar, discovery and studying/understanding.</p>

			<p>School never captured or inspired a single piece of me so when it was time to leave and I saw that there was a music college only a short commute from my folks house - I knew I had to try out. I learned a piece and went for an audition, they accepted and that was it. The environment was perfect, the teachers did not pressure, the work was incentive based and the quality or standards of ‘how work should be’ was subjective. We’re all different, we all thrive in different surroundings... this environment however allowed me the freedom to try and experience things for myself, rarely being monitored or having someone breathe down your neck with their expectations, preconceived ideas of good and bad, presumptions, precognitions, set standards...</p>

			<p>May 2008, at 17, I passed my driving test and booked a tour with my band that December, still in college at the time and with a part time job at Morrison’s we just went out not knowing what to expect, it was 100% DIY, it was disorganised, we weren’t the greatest of bands but that was the experience that solidified how I continued to live (in many amalgamations, each better than the last).</p>

			<p>When time at college was up I chose a speciality and enrolled at SSR, Manchester studying Sound Engineering and Design learning about the technical side of everything I already loved. Studying, touring and working jobs at this level was the most demanding thing my 19 year old self knew but I pushed each discipline to the limits (thanks to modofinil, perhaps). The second year I had saved most of my wages, student loans and got a small loan from my ever-loving family. This was what I used to set up my first recording studio ‘Head Sounds Recording Studio’. In the third year I was pulled aside and told that touring 6 weeks of the term, taking any and many random weeks off to record bands/artists and maintaining studies was no longer sustainable in the final months of the degree. While I felt I could handle it I was left with no choice about these commitments and chose to not cancel 6 weeks of touring and multiple recording contracts. I left the degree incomplete to honour the commitments I had made to the real world of music. If life were going to continue in the form it was taking, university would never be a realistic option.</p>

			<p>Years passed, much touring happened, many recording contracts happened at Head Sounds until it was tragically burgled in May 2014. This forced me to reassess and reconnect with my career and pushed me, kicking and screaming, into an entirely free-lance world of audio and music. This is where I continue to live and thrive in whichever studio, with whatever artist.</p>

			<h1>Testaments</h1>

			<p>I got in touch to Ed through a mutual friend in Night Lives here in Finland and after hearing their stuff, was convinced that we've found our guy! Ed really delivered an awesome set of masters for our upcoming self-titled album. Really wish to catch up over a beer in the future, true gent!" -  Ilkka / Cigarette Crossfire</p>


			<p>“Ed was very prompt and efficient when it came to getting my first draft masters back to me. He was always available to talk about the project and took on board my opinions. I was extremely happy with his work I felt it brought a new life to my tracks. I will most certainly be going back to Ed to work on future projects together.”
			Perkie / Perkie & The Perkettes </p>

			<p>"A true professional with just the right style and vision to make flawless work on our album master." Mikael Neves / Recording Engineer & Night Lives</p>



			<p>“Going to head Ed one of the most positive decisions our band could have made, the laid back yet professional atmosphere suits creative individuals perfectly, the facilities were more than adequate and Ed went above and beyond the call of duty to help make a product we didn't know was possible.” Nathaniel / LSP</p>


			<p>“Ed is a great engineer with a with perfect balance of knowledge, musicality and people skills. Even when the session was at it's most fraught, Ed was a deepened calm zen like presence that kept us all on task and the end result sounded great” Tom Peters / Recording Engineer (The Grand Studio) / Alpha Male Tea Party </p>


			<p>“Ed has a professional attitude to recording. With his professional setup and extensive knowledge, he knows how to get the sound you want. If he doesn't he will damn well learn how! I love that peckerwood.” Josh / The Hostiles </p>

			<p>“Ed is one heck of a guy and his mastering is just as good! Really professional, affordable and quick, but most importantly the songs sound awesome! Thank you again mate!” - Liam / Lost Ground</p>

		<div class="text">
			<p>Guitar was where this began, we all need hobbies and passions outside of our main occupation and guitar tuition has become a job I love in many different ways to audio. I’ve been playing for 12 years and from my short time teaching professionally and privately I’m confident I can improve most players from beginner to advance in most styles of playing.</p>

			<p>I offer lessons over Skype or in person if the distance is realistic. </p>
